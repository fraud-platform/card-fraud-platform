# Documentation

This folder follows the cross-repo docs standard for the Fraud Platform org.

## Naming Standard

- Use lowercase kebab-case for markdown files: `local-setup.md`, `security-hardening.md`.
- Use numbered lowercase folders for ordered sections: `01-setup`, `02-development`.
- Avoid mixed case, spaces, and underscores in file/folder names.
- Keep archived or draft notes out of published docs (`archive/`, `TODO`, `STATUS`).

## Publication Policy (Current)

Only curated docs are tracked in Git for now:

- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/codemap.md`

All other local docs remain untracked until they are reorganized and reviewed.
