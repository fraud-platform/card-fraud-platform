# Card Fraud Platform Documentation

Shared Docker Compose orchestrator for local multi-service development.

## Audience

- New developers setting up this repository locally.
- Coding agents that need deterministic, executable setup/test instructions.

## Quick Start

```powershell
uv sync
uv run platform-up
uv run platform-up -- --apps
uv run platform-status
```

## Documentation Standards

- Keep published docs inside `docs/01-setup` through `docs/07-reference`.
- Use lowercase kebab-case file names (for example `local-setup.md`).
- Exceptions: `README.md`, `codemap.md`, and machine-generated contract files (for example `openapi.json`).
- Do not publish TODO, session notes, or archive artifacts.
